## Communucation and Interpersonal Effectiveness
### Birdcall Strategy Revision
<i>Autumn 2025</i>
<br>
<br>As part of my business strategy class, we had the opportunity to work with the executives of a local quick service food company: Birdcall. We worked in small teams of 4, researching the industry and competitors while optomizing Birdcall's resources and strengths to create and improve their competitive advantage. It was a great opportunity to be face to face with executives and apply my work to a real business case. It was also a great leadership opportunity, I managed my team by setting checkpoints based on the assignment rubric and scheduled hybrid meetings to make sure members weren't left behind. Our team was well organized and delivered a refined proposal for the Birdcall executives. 
<br>
<br>I took on the roll of researching the quick service food industry, and was able to find a niche that my team could build our strategy around. From my research, I was able to develop a PESTEL analysis on the industry and Porter's 5 Force model which helped my team and I find the most practical and sustainable recommendations.

### Database Project: Lord of Logistics 
<i>Spring 2024</i>
<br>
<br>For my Enterprise Technology class in Spring of 2024, I was tasked with planning, designing, buiulding, and integrating a back end rugged database along with a front end GUI complete with a customized GAI tool. For this project I used Visio for high level design, Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio for storage and standardization, as well as Microsoft Visual Studio for python and html scripting. We were able to access OpenAI's models using an API key and tailored the model in python by connecting it to the database, managing memory, and giving it a personality. The goal of this project was to take the complex backend technology of databases and output the information through a GUI to make it digestible to users.  
<br>
<br>I began this project by aggregating data surrounding crude oil and possible shocks that could affect prices. I took historic stock information on the crude oil trade as well as country metrics such as reserves and exports. I also aggregated information on oil spills based on size and region as well as conflict counts of regions reflecting large scale armed conflict. The purpose of this was to store information on the crude oil trade along with data on shocks that can affect it.

### Datawarehouse Project: AeroGrub
<i>Fall 2024</i>
<br>
<br>During my Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence class in Fall 2025, my partner and I used their AeroGrub database to plan, design, and build an enterprise data mart using SQL Server, Visio, Visual Studio, Excel, and Power BI. Throughout this process, I created busienss requirements and designed the data mart; built the data mart; extracted, transformed, and loaded (ETL) the data mart; and developed reports and dashboards from the data mart to answer the the business requirements' questions.

### Optomizing Business Processes
<i>Winter 2024</i>
<br>
<br>In my Optomization Modeling class, I learned how to streamline and optomize processes based on certain restraints using python. We solved questions of distributions systems by minimizing distance traveled, and questions of profit optomization based on raw material inventory and sales expectations. The final project for this course was todevelop a optomization equation to find the most optimal NBA fantasy team. I did this by implementing scoring weights for aspects like age, blocks, turnovers, and 3 point scores. I needed to design contraints that chose players from each position and fit under a certain budget price, much like a real life fantasy draft.
