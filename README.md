### Microsoft Office Certification Program
<i>Fall 2019 - Spring 2022</i>
<br>
<br>The Daniels College of Business offers a Microsoft Office Certification Program that teaches Advanced Excel, Excel, Word, and PowerPoint classes, preparing students to pass the certification exams for each of these programs and to apply these skills in their classwork and professional work. After completing the classes and certification exams myself, I applied for a position as a Junior TA with the program, and I quickly advanced to teaching my own classes and then managing the program. My quick advancement came with many personal reservations about whether I was ready to fill those roles. Nonetheless, I pursued the opportunities, recognizing others saw my potential and knowing my own drive and ability to learn, adapt, and meet challenges. By doing so, I developed countless valuable skills and made a positive impact on my students and team.
<br>
<br>In my time managing the program as TA Coordinator, we have faced numerous challenges, including being fully remote for a year, onboarding almost an entirely new team while returning to in-person learning, having limited staff, and adapting to constant changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors. To best prepare our team for these challenges, I updated all our program materials, developed a robust onboarding program, and facilitated ongoing training through a series of workshops. Further, I taught an Excel class to a group of 80 students—a class size never seen before in Daniels. Despite these challenges, we saw incredibly high student pass rates on the certification exams, resulting from the development of a strong TA team. 
<br>
<br>The opportunities I have received and work I have done with this program facilitated immense personal and professional growth. I developed skills in public speaking, teaching, facilitating, mentoring, managing, and driving growth. Further, I learned my resilience and adaptability in navigating uncertainty and challenges. With all this, the most rewarding aspect of my role is seeing the growth and success of those around me, including students and my team.

      <td>
        <b>Hiring and Onboarding:</b> I had the opportunity to participate in the hiring process for our team, including creating application and interview questions, reviewing applications, and conducting interviews. Through this process, I learned how to identify candidates that will add value to our team, and it helped me understand the hiring process from an employer's perspective, giving me insight for my own job search process. In writing interview and application questions and making hiring decisions, I regularly checked myself for unconscious biases and influences, ensuring the best decisions were made. After hiring, I developed an onboarding program to prepare our new team members for success and facilitated the three-day training.

      <td>
        <b>Training and Development:</b> To promote our team's continued learning, I proposed and implemented ongoing development through regular meetings and workshops. These workshops include expanding technical skills, developing teaching skills, promoting personal growth, and facilitating team cohesion. In planning these workshops and activities, I identified our team's needs and growth areas, often by asking team members, and I took the appropriate steps to bring those learnings to them. In some instances, this entailed partnering with other departments on campus to bring trainings to our team, such as those on supporting mental health, teaching and facilitating, connecting across worldviews, and responding to microagressions. Other times, I developed trainings from my own ongoing learning, such as those on teaching methodologies and techniques, giving and receiving feedback, and personal narratives and limiting beliefs. Additionally, I developed a variety of activities surrounding reflection, goal setting, and feedback implementation.
          <br><br><blockquote>Developing these trainings challenged me to continue expanding my own skill set, as I educated myself on a variety of topics and brought a selection of those back to my team. In doing this, I learned to transform my own learning into engaging activities from which my team could also learn. Further, I gained facilitation skills, particularly in promoting meaningful conversation. Beyond this, I practiced networking in finding people with knowledge beyond my own to supplement our team's growth.</blockquote>

      <td>
        <b>Developing Curriculum and Teaching:</b> To prepare students for the certification exams and to equip them with valuable skills for their classwork and professional work, I regularly evaluated our curriculum and made the appropriate modifications. Doing so helped me develop skills in the methodologies of teaching–when to introduce concepts, how material builds on itself, the role of review, and more. Teaching this material further expanded my skill set, particularly in adapting to student needs, troubleshooting issues, managing a classroom, public speaking, and defusing tense situations. Often, class would not go exactly as planned, and I shift accordingly. Further, I gained experience in fairly supporting and accommodating students, particularly with the stressors of the COVID-19 pandemic. Teaching is incredibly rewarding–seeing students' "lightbulb" or "that's so cool" moments will always be one of my favorites.

    <tr>
      <td>
        <b>Operations:</b> My goal has always been to maximize time spent supporing students and TAs and growing the program, which means minimizing time spent on administrative work. To accomplish that, I sought to streamline processes and communications and eliminate repetitive work. One example of this is the VBA code I wrote to automate a frequent task, allowing time and efforts to be focused elsewhere and serving as an opportunity to expand my coding skills. Another example is reviewing and modifying all communications to ensure they are clear and concise, eliminating confusion and excessive communication.

<tr>
      <td>
        <b>Management:</b> Management can be challenging, particularly in the last two years with the uncertainty and stressors of the COVID-19 pandemic. Being in a management role during this time, I learned how to balance the needs of the program with the needs of our people. I often shifted plans as new challenges surfaced, and I did so while prioritizing our people. Further, I learned to make tough decisions and to have tough conversations. Through this, I realized my resilience and adaptability: I rose to the challege each time (and there were a lot of times) and saw successes more often than not. When there was not an initial success, I learned and adjusted going forward. Despite the challenges, I found management highly rewarding, and I really enjoy working with people in that capacity.

### Daniels Ambassador Team
<i>Fall 2019 - Winter 2022</i>
<br>
<br>When touring schools as a high school student, my favorite experiences to hear about were those of the students. I found their perspectives valuable in learning about the school and identifying whether I could see myself at that school. Once in college, I wanted to do the same for other prospective students. After not receiving an offer for the tour guide position with Admissions, I reached out to the Manager of Enrollment Services at Daniels, who I worked with when applying myself, asking about opportunities to work with prospective students. To my excitment, there was a position with the Daniels Ambassador Team (DAT).
<br>
<br>With DAT, I shared my experiences and answered questions in conversational and panel settings, helping prospective students find the University for them across academic, social, cultural, and graduate outcomes. In doing this, I developed public speaking skills, gained experience in presentation flow with multiple presenters (panel setting), and learned how to prepare for unknown questions. Prior to these sessions, I considered my experiences in relation to what could be asked of me; however, I did not know the exact questions, meaning I drew from my experiences while thinking on my feet–an important skill for many settings. Further, I learned how to feel comfortable and confident in what was often a pressure-filled environment, given prospective students and families were evaluating me and the University. Beyond the skills I developed, I enjoyed meeting and talking to prospective students and families from across the country. The college search process can be overwhelming, and I hope I was able to alleviate some of that for them.

### Writing Samples
#### Child Emotional Maltreatment: Identifying Child Emotional Maltreatment and Intervening
<i>Fall 2020</i>
<br>
<br>In this blog post, I researched child abuse, specifically emotional maltreatment, and distilled the complex information into language understood by a non-scientific audience. This helped me develop skills in understanding scientific work and reframing it for consumption beyond a scientific audience. These skills apply to my technical analytic work and to my teaching, as technical concepts often must be explained in non-technical terms to be understood by a broader audience.

[<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91146906/162126570-0ee09e62-f24d-4a2a-8d68-3fcb47da7c67.svg" height="35"/>](../DanielsDistinctionPortfolio/ChildEmotionalMaltreatmentBlogPost.pdf)

#### The Impacts of Screen Time on Mental, Emotional, and Relational Health in Children Ages 0-10
<i>Fall 2020</i>
<br>
<br>In this paper, I summarized the results of existing scientific articles related to the impact of screen time on mental, emotional, and relational health in children ages 0-10. Then, I developed a research proposal for future research related to the topic. This required critical thinkning in identifying gaps in existing research and then brainstorming how to bridge those gaps.

### Wellness Living and Learning Community
<i>Fall 2018 - Spring 2019</i>
<br>
<br>The Wellness Living and Learning Community (LLC) is a group of first-year students living and taking academic classes together. I joined this community to help myself integrate into college with the support of those holding similar values and goals as myself. In my first weeks of school, I remember counting the hours I was expected to spend weekly on my classes and job: 18 hours of class, 36-54 hours of classwork, 10 hours of work, plus time for myself. At that point, I could not fathom how this was possible: When was I supposed to find time for myself? In this challenging transition, I sought balance through my academic and personal wellness journeys, and the Wellness LLC helped me focus on cultivating and maintaining a healthy lifestyle as it applies to self, spirituality, and community.
<br>
<br>The classes and experiences in the Wellness LLC challenged me to prioritize my own wellness, in addition to the wellness of those around me. With the opportunity to explore and try new things, I learned a great deal about myself and the impact I can have on those around me. My time with the Wellness LLC enhanced my first year of college, and it gave me new perspective in navigating subsequent years, including that relating to my own wellness journey and my role in supporting others' journeys.

        <b>Personal Wellness:</b> Through the classes and experiences in the Wellness LLC, I identified and prioritized the areas of life most prevelant to my wellbeing, including exercising, eating well, sleeping, and connecting with those around me. Further, I explored spirituality through meditation, a practice with which I struggle. While I never "mastered" consistently prioritizing these areas, the Wellness LLC provided structure and support for my personal wellness journey, and challenged me to expand my personal wellness practices. Being part of this community allowed me to better develop the valuable foundation from which my personal wellness journey continues.

        <b>Community and Social Wellness:</b> In learning about community and social wellness and the processes involved in defining, maintaining, and improving it, my peers and I developed a project proposal for meeting the physcial activity needs of first-year students at the University of Denver. In doing these, we identified and gained an understanding of the community; defined the problem, including its scope, impact, influential factors, and existing resources; and proposed strategies for addressing the problem, including an app connecting "workout buddies," a resource workshop, and a club sports access fund. Throughout this process, I learned the intricate nature of community and social wellness, the challenges in addressing concerns, and the intersections between individual wellness and community and social wellness. A key takeaway was the power individuals and groups possess to make change in their communities.

        <b>Volunteering:</b> Giving back to the community, particularly through volunteer work, is a key component of both community and personal wellness. With the Wellness LLC, I volunteered at a community garden in Denver, completing the necessary work to tend to the gardens. Additionally, I volunteered at the Fischer Early Learning Center's Spring Fling, helping them raise money to support their students. Both these experiences were rewarding in supporting the community and developing relationships with my fellow volunteers.

    <tr>
      <td>
        <b>Retreats:</b> With the Wellness LLC, I went on several retreats, including those to Stone Canyon EdVentures and Glenwood Hot Springs. These provided opportunities to disconnect, reflect, recenter, and nurture relationships with my peers. On one retreat, I spent several hours laying in my hamock in the woods. Initially, this sounded boring and even daunting; however, I was able to clear my mind, reflect, and connect with nature. Additionally, I spent uninterrupted time with my peers, having fun and making memories. These experiences highlighted the importance of taking time for myself and being present, as I left retreats feeling refreshed and energized.

        <b>Co-Curricular Activities:</b> I regularly participated in co-curricular activities that would expand and support my wellness journey.

These activities allowed me to take time for myself and, in many cases, learn or try something new.

### Thrive Peer Health Educator
<i>April 2019 - June 2020</i>
<br>
<br>When entering college, I found myself nervous about the stories of peer pressure surrounding alcohol; the prevalance of sexual assault on college campuses; and how busy students across campus seemed to be, with expectations to take heavy class loads in addition to being involved across campus. I quickly learned the need to find balance and empower myself in making the choices best for me–something that comes easy in some ways and continues to be challenging in others. In finding this balance and empowerment for myself, I wanted to support other students in doing the same, leading me to the Thrive Peer Health Educator team.
<br>
<br>The Thrive Peer Health Educator team is a group of undergraduate students seeking to empower the DU community to make informed choices regarding alcohol and other drugs, sexual health, and mental health. In this role, I positively impacted the DU community through sharing knowledge and resources and starting conversations around traditionally stigmatized issues in an effort to normalize them. While doing this, I developed and expanded my own knowledge around these topics; obtained skills related to educating, facilitating, event planning, and program development; and observed and experienced people-first management.
<br>
<br>While my time as a Thrive Peer Health Educator was relatively short, it made a significant impact on me, and I carry forward many lessons and skills, in addition to my continued passion for the topics. In my later role as the TA Coordinator for the Microsoft Certification Program, I brought members of this team to discuss mental health with my new team, recoginizing the widespread importance of the topic. Further, observing the people-first management style and the resulting success I experienced as a team member influenced my leadership style, as I strive to build connection within teams and to see those I interact with as human first. By caring for each other as humans first, I believe we will have more to offer and deliver in our various capacities.

        <b>Weekly Tabling:</b> I facilitated outreach events in residence halls to raise awareness surrounding alcohol and drugs, sexual health, and mental health. This outreach included engaging students through trivia and other activities, serving as a quick and fun interaction to start a conversation surrounding these important and prevalent topics. While we facilitated numerous activities, the drink pouring activity is my favorite. Using water, participants pour a standard drink of beer, wine, and liquor to their best estimate; then, we measure it. This promotes safe drinking strategies, inclduing pouring and counting drinks accurately.
        <br><br><blockquote>My experiences with this outreach helped me develop skills in engaging and educating my peers. Our first challenge was in getting passersby to approach our table and engage in the activity. In doing this, I learned tricks for catching others' attention and engaging them, often through humor and relatability. The next challenge was relaying information in an effictive way and navigating contradictory opinions. I found rooting my knowledge in the facual information I was trained, directing to resources, and being open to conversation and questions to be helpful. I recognize I always have more to learn, and approaching with that mindset and curiousity helped build bridges across differing opinions and experiences.</blockquote>

    <tr>
      <td>
        <b>Moments of Mindfulness:</b> I hosted weekly destress events–Moments of Mindfulness–in the residence halls, creating an opportunity and space to decompress and focus on mental well-being. These events included making friendship bracelets and coloring, in addition to having peer educators available to engage in conversation and offer resources as appropriate.
        <br><br><blockquote>While these events created a valuable mindfulness space for students, they also taught me the importance of creating space for yourself to decompress. Each week, I was reminded how refreshing it can be to take an hour to reset. This is a lesson I seek to carry forward for myself and for others in my leadership roles.

        <b>Mental Health Workshop Facilitation:</b> I led a "Success, Not Stress" workshop for a campus sorority, helping students better understand stress and how to manage it. This included learning what stress is, how it can be helpful and harmful, positive and negative coping mechanisms, how to manage stress in the long-term, and how to identify when it is more than "just stress."
        <br><br><blockquote>Seeing how stress can be positive is one of my favorite elements of this presentation. What if we think about stress as something to help us meet a challenge and succeed, rather than something to avoid? <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/kelly_mcgonigal_how_to_make_stress_your_friend?language=en" target="_blank">This TED Talk</a> by Kelly McGonigal talks about the benefit of making stress your friend, which is something I strive to adapt in my own mindset.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>Faciliating this workshop helped me develop skills in guided questioning. Rather than dictating the information, it is most effective when participants engage, brainstorm, and come to ideas on their own. A key component of this presentation is asking participants questions to guide them to the talking points, allowing the material to better resonate.</blockquote>

        <b>Thriving on Your 21st Birthday Program:</b> When turning 21, individuals often participate in drinking activities and face new challenges, whether drinking for the first time, drinking in new or unfamiliar environments, or feeling pressured to drink more than they are comfortable. The 21st Birthday Initiative is a partnership with local businesses to promote safe drinking practices while celebrating one's 21st birthday. The week of their 21st birthday, participants receive a coupon book and information session, providing resources for a safer and more enjoyable celebration. The coupons include free and reduced-price food from local restaurants, as eating while using substances is a harm reduction strategy and offers an alternative to using substances.
        <br><br><blockquote> I was on the committee adapting this program for our campus, including brainstoriming ideas, developing materials, and establishing relationships with community partners. Unfortunately, I was no longer serving in the peer educator role once the program launched. Nonetheless, the program is successful, and the opportunity helped me develop important skills, including developing community relations, garnering support for a project and issue I am passionate about, and managing a long-term project (using a Trello board I created and trained our team on).

        <b>Free STI Testing Events:</b> To promote sexual health on campus, the Health Promotion team at the Health and Counseling Center hosts community partners to provide free STI testing. At these events, I checked-in community members and offered information and resources. Additionally, I collected the information voluntarily provided by participating community members and reported it using visualizations, allowing us to better understand who attended the event, how they heard about it, and what additional programming is wanted. This then allowed our team to make improvements for future events.
        <br><br><blockquote>At these events, I developed skills in creating a welcoming, safe, and non-judgemental environment. Due to the stigma associated with sexual health, this can be an uncomfortable experience for many, and I strived to meet others at their comfort level, ensuring they felt safe.</blockquote>

### Human Leadership Program
<i>August 2021</i>
<br>
<br>The book <i>Permission to Screw Up: How I Learned to Lead by Doing (Almost) Everything Wrong</i> by Kristen Hadeed was my favorite read in college, although not for a class. In this book, Kristen told her story, beginning with her experiences starting and growing her business in college and including the valuable lessons she learned along the way. Her story particularly resonated with me because she was a college student managing college students, like I am doing in college. While reading, I connected with many of her experiences and appreciated her perspective. This book inspired me in many ways, and when the opportunity to attend her Human Leadership Program arose, I registered in hopes of continuing to learn and challenge myself as a leader.
<br>
<br>At Kristen Hadeed's <a href="https://www.kristenhadeed.com/humanleadershipprogram" target="_blank">Human Leadership Program</a>, we covered thinkning, trusting, communicating, growing, caring, and inspiring like a leader. These conversations included our personal narratives and how they impact our mindset and behavior; vulnerability in the workplace and our ability to build, maintain, and strengthen trust; our ability to give, receive, and solicit feedback; our resillience and ability to face fear, failure, challeges, and uncertainty; our ability to take care of ourselves so we can serve others; and our ability to take ownership and make an impact. Throughout the program, I learned about myself, identified areas I need to improve, and gained valuable tools and perspective in how to be a leader that empowers others. I regularly refer to what I learned in these two days while intentionally understanding and guiding my interactions with others. Not only have I implemented my takeaways from these two days in my own leadership, I have brought the conversations I found most impactful back to my Microsoft Certification TA team, adapting workshops on feedback and personal narratives to facilitate conversation and development surrounding these important topics. Leadership is an area we can always grow and improve, and the Human Leadership Program taught me to lead with love as my most authentic, human self–something I strive to do every day.

        <b>Think Like a Leader:</b> How life experiences shape mindset and behavior, and how to harness elements of mindset that fuel forward, while reframing those that hold back.
        <br><br><blockquote>In reflecting on the most challenging personal relationships in my life and by identifying my personal narratives, I recognized "it is my job to make you happy" as the personal narrative with the biggest impact on my life. I am a peacekeeper, and this stems from my experiences growing up. This personal narrative has many positive impacts: I care deeply about others, do what I can to help others, and consider others when making decisions. However, it also has negative impacts: Always seeking to please others can result in an unsustainable amount of work toward an often impossible goal (always making everyone happy), creating an immense and exhausting weight. While I appreciate the positives of this personal narrative and continue to harness them, I recognize the need to set boundaries and prioritize my wellbeing. To support others to the best of my ability, I also need to take care of myself. Thus, I seek to reframe this limiting belief: It is my hope to make others happy by being kind, although it is not my job. While I better recognize this tendency now, it continues to be a challenge.</blockquote>
        <blockquote><b>Key takeaway:</b> Everyone has their own limiting beliefs impacting their mindset and behaviors. How can we help each other recognize and face our limiting beliefs?</blockquote>

      <td>
        <b>Trust Like a Leader:</b> How to build, maintain, and strengthen trust in relationships, in addition to the role of vulnerability at work.
        <br><br><blockquote>I believe vulnerability belongs in the workplace because we are all human and being vulnerable allows us to see each other as such. While there is a line for oversharing, vulnerability creates a genuine environment for teams and normalizes asking for help, creating a stronger and more empowered team. How do we make people feel seen and heard? Truly listen and reflectively respond. How can we ask questions in a way that promotes vulnerability and connection? In our relationships, we have emotional bank accounts that grow with deposits and shrink with withdrawls. How can we build balances to stregthen our relationships and trust?</blockquote>
        <blockquote><b>Key takeaway:</b> I strongly value the ideas and experiences of others. However, I often face two challenges: (1) Setting aside distractions to truly listen and (2) giving up control in trusting others. When listening to others, my attention may wander to the tasks floating in my head, and when working with others, I struggle to trust and transfer ownership. The following help me face these challenges: (1) I schdeule time for myself to be mentally present and then intentionally clear my mind at that time, and (2) I weigh the value of the work being completed by me versus the value of trusting and empowering another.</blockquote>

      <td>
        <b>Communicate Like a Leader:</b> How to give, receive, and solicit feedback in using communication to build connection and trust.
        <br><br><blockquote>Giving feedback is challenging, and a positive versus negative experience impacts the relationship, one developing trust and the other breaking it, respectively. There are two forms of feedback: Growth feedback inspiring change and recognition feedback inspiring repetition. The most valuable feedback highlights the feeling, behavior, and impact, and we can take several actions to better give, receive, and solicit feedback for optimal experience and development.</blockquote>
        <blockquote><b>Key takeaway:</b> People give feedback because they care, and that is now my perspective when both giving and receiving feedback. Since this session, I have intentionally impemented key steps in my feedback interactions. In receiving feedback, I start with "thank you" then "tell me more" to develop trust and fully understand the feedback. In giving feedback, I strive to follow the FBI model, sharing the feeling, behavior, and impact.</blockquote>

        <b>Grow Like a Leader:</b> How to grow resilience and ability to face fear, failure, and setbacks.
        <br><br><blockquote>Although easier said than done, I believe failing is acceptable, given you learn from it. A healthy relationship with failure enables you to take risks and try new things, and resiliency is how we move through challenges, learn, and bounce back with passion and curiousity. What about success? I define success as being proud of myself and happy with the outcome, although others may define it differently. Like failure, there can be a fear in success. With success comes responsibility and a pressure to both maintain and improve upon that success. In building a "resilience resume," I reflected on challenging situations, what I learned from them, and how I grew, allowing me to recoginize my capability and adaptability.</blockquote>
        <blockquote><b>Key takeaways:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Approach fear with curiosity, exploring and planning what to do in various scenarios.</li> 
            <li>Take first step with permission to do it bad: If you do nothing, cannot make it better–do something then make it better.</li>
            <li>In uncertainty, find certainty: Identify and focus efforts on what can be controlled.</li>
            <li>Empower others in overcoming challenges: Say "tell me more..." to help people find the answers they already have; ask others three ideas to approach a challenge and the recommendation; ask questions rather than give solutions.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Slow down to speed up: Take time and give others the opportunity to try something new–train them.</li>

        <b>Care Like a Leader:</b> How to care for yourself, adopting habits to show up your best so you can better serve others.
        <br><br><blockquote>Taking care of myself is challenging for me in the sense that I always put others first. However, I recognize that adopting habits to care for myself will allow me to show up at my best and, ultimately, will allow me to better serve others. With that in mind, I am working to identify and do things for myself that will enable me to best serve others. This includes taking inventory on my satisfaction with various areas of my life and whether I am prioritizing those most important to me; identifying things that bring me energy and things that drain my energy; and creating routines that foster a positive mindset and environment for myself. Further, I consider burnout prevention, particularly setting and communicating boundaries. In addition to caring for myself, my role as a learder includes supporing others' work-life harmony, particularly in helping others set boundaries and then adapting my work and expectations to respect those boundaries.</blockquote>
        <blockquote><b>Key takeaway:</b> We must care for ourselves and prevent burnout to the extent that time off is not recovery but rather time to do what we enjoy. As a learder, this is two-fold: (1) How can I do this for myself, and (2) how can I foster this on my team?</blockquote>

        <br><br><blockquote>To be authentic in what I do, it is important to identify my values and to live my life by them. The five values I identified for myself are (1) show kindness, (2) seek balance, (3) live with passion, (4) foster learning and growth, and (5) be dependable. Additionally, I set my leadership vision: I am a leader constantly striving to grow and inspire others–I lead with passion and love; I listen and empower; and I help others be the best they can be.</blockquote>
        <blockquote><b>Key takeaway:</b> It is not what I want to be but who I want to be. I get to decide who I want to be and have the ability to be just that. Further, I have the ability to make my mark–big deep to identify what that is and have the courage to pursue it.</blockquote>

### Internship: St. Vrain Valley School District - District Technology Services
<i>Summer 2019, Summer 2020, Summer 2021</i>
<br>
<br>For three consecutive summers, I was an intern on the DevOps team at St. Vrain Valley School District. On my first day with this team, my supervisor asked about my technical skill set, to which I shared my basic Excel knowledge. In return, I got a puzzled look and one question: Do you know SQL? Seeing as I had never heard of SQL, I was now the puzzled one. Returning home after that first day, I immediately found an online course from which to learn SQL over the weekend, equipping myself with the skills to support and contribute to this team. 
<br>
<br>Since then, I received the opportunity to expand my SQL skills working in a large, production database while contributing to a variety of projects impacting stakeholders across the school district, including attendance reports and a student performance application. Through these projects, I quickly learned valuable skills, particularly from the experienced team mentoring me. My <b>technical skills</b> were expanded in writing readable, optimized code to solve complex problems. Further, I was challenged to <b>think critically</b> in designing and developing solutions that serve as a foundation for the district's future student success work. As with all data-related projects, ethical use of data to inform <b>ethical decision making</b> was at the cornerstone of this work, particularly in ensuring the accurate representation of data.

    <br>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <b>Data Managment and Analytics Platforms:</b> In helping envision and enable the school district's future data work, I evaluated twelve request for information responses and completed two proof of concepts for data management and analytics platforms. My focus in this evaluation was on data visualization, particularly the potential of tools to empower decision making through data visualization. I had the opportunity to work closely with vendors in this process, and I gave my feedback regarding the products' potential.
        <br><br><blockquote><b>Critical Thinking:</b> Evaluating products required deep critical thinking in considering the school district's needs and the ability of each product to meet those needs. I had to intentionally consider how to complete the proof of concepts to gain an understanding of the tools and had to purposefully ask the vendors questions to accurately evaluate the tools.</blockquote>
        <blockquote><b>Ethical Decision Making:</b> Ethical practices were used throughout this process to ensure (1) successful proof of concepts with  anonymized data and (2) fair assessment across products. In doing this, evaluation criteria and guidelines were developed.</blockquote>

    <tr>
      <td>
        <b>Attendance Reporting:</b> Attendnace is a surprisingly complex calculation. Much of my attendance work centered around reading and understaning others' code, pinpointing discrepancies in calculations, and optimizing queries for more readable code and a better user experience. Further, I documented my thought process for reference. Key accomplishments from my attendance work include (1) evaluating accuracy of attendance calculations for reporting and (2) rewriting SQL query to run in 12 seconds, rather than 2.5 minutes.
        <br><br><blockquote><b>Critical Thinkning:</b> Reading and understanding another analyst's code required critical thinking, particularly in determining why that analyst did something in a certain way. Did they find a specific use case that they accounted for with this code, or is it a redundancy that can be optimized? Further, determining how to accurately calculate attendance required critical thinkning.</blockquote>
        <blockquote><b>Ethical Decision Making:</b> Accurate attendance reporting has many implications for ethical decision making, especially given the variety of reasons students may miss school and the associated intervention and student support.

      <td>
        <b>Student Performance Project:</b> I was the backend programmer on this project developed to empower early intervention for students failing their coursework. The lead programmer and myself worked closely with an assistant principal to understand their current (manual) process for gathering information and what additional information was desired. In automating that process and meeting those needs, I helped design and develop an application that positively impacts student success and serves as the foundation for current and future student performance work.
        <br><br><blockquote><b>Critical Thinkning:</b> This project required a snapshot of data not already captured, necessitating critical thinkning in how to capture that information to use in reporting. Additionally, as a backend programmer, I critically considered how my work interacted with that of the frontend programmer, ensuring modifications to my work did not interfere with their work.</blockquote>
        <blockquote><b>Ethical Decision Making:</b> To empower ethical decision making, I worked with my fellow programmers to ensure we accurately reported data. Further, we included the appropriate data for decision makers to take informed and ethical next steps. Data security was another important component, particularly in granting access to data based on the users' credentials and authorization.</blockquote>

### Database Project: Back to Roots OLTP
<i>Winter 2021</i>
<br>
<br>During my Foundations or Information Management class in Winter 2021, I was tasked with planning, designing, building, and programming aspects of an information management system using Microsoft Word (documentation), Visio (diagraming), and Access (relational database). This included designing a relational database, simulating data, building the relational database in Access, loading the data into the relational database, querying the relational database using SQL, and developing relational database forms and reports, including using VBA macros, functions, and sub procedures.
<br>
<br><i>Spring 2021</i>
<br>
<br>During my Enterprise Information Management class in Spring 2021, I expanded this relational database, adding tables and moving it to Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. This included designing, building, and programing an enterprise information management database using SQL Server and Azure; designing, building, and programing interactive forms using Visual Studio and SQL Server; and designing, building, and programing a Windows integrated application, along with reports, using Visual Studio and SQL Server. Throughout this process, I used SQL (build script, function, stored procedure, views, reports) and Visual Basic (forms).

### Database Project: Back to Roots OLAP
<i>Fall 2021</i>
<br>
<br>During my Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence class in Fall 2021, I used my Back to Roots OLTP to plan, design, and build an enterprise data mart (OLAP) using SQL Server, Visio, Visual Studio, Excel, and Power BI. Throughout this process, I created busienss requirements and designed the data mart; built the data mart; extracted, transformed, and loaded (ETL) the data mart; and developed reports and dashboards from the data mart to answer the the business requirements' questions.

### Automating Business Processes with VBA
<i>Winter 2021 - Spring 2022</i>
<br>
<br>In my Automating Business Processes class, I learned how to streamline processes and reduce repetitive work, specifically using VBA in Excel. After just a couple weeks, I realized the real impact this could have on the work I was doing for the Microsoft Office Certification Program. By automating repetitive, time-consuming tasks, my team and I could focus our energies elsewhere, like on maximizing support for TAs and students and growing the program.
<br>
<br>The repetitive task I identified and sought to automate was matching registrations for the certification exams against a list of students supposed to be registered for those exams. While it may seem trivial, this consumed unnecessary time and effort when completed manually, particularly given how frequently the task is completed. After understanding the process and goal, I designed and developed a solution to complete this task with the click of a button, and I added additional functionality, like error checking, to better meet our needs and even improve our work. Since its implementation, I have trained team members on how to use it, provided documentation, and maintained and improved it. This is just one example of identifying a problem and developing a solution, ultimately allowing our team to minimize repetitive work and maximize time and energies on student, staff, and program development.
<br>
<br>This project allowed me to develop my skill set, particularly related to coding and seeing a project through every phase of the development cycle including planning, analysis, design, implementation, testing, training, and maintenance.

Traveling internationally and educating myself on cultures other than my own has always been a passion of mine. With that, I have traveled to thirteen countries with many opportunities to engage with locals, whether living with a host family in Spain or visiting a slum in India.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, my study abroad program to New Zealand was cancelled, and I did not have the opportunity to travel abroad in college. Nonetheless, I found opportunities at DU to expand by intercultural competence, practice inclusive excellence, and consider multiple perspectives. Further, I am planning a trip abroad for Summer 2022 to continue growing in these areas.

### Exploring Global Citizenship
<i>Fall 2019</i>
<br>
<br>Although my study abroad program was cancelled, I took a class on Exploring Global Citizenship in preparation of going abroad. This course helped me examine how my own culture and identity may interact with other cultures. Specifically, I examined how historical events, political climates, and social disparities surrounding privilege may influence others' views of and assumptions about me. Further, I educated myself on subtle cultural differences I may encounter, inlcluding differences in language and communication, approach to conflict, and cultural tendencies ([Hofstede's cultural dimensions](https://www.hofstede-insights.com/)).
<br>
<br>The awareness I developed in this course proved worthwhile beyond studying abroad, as it applies to my interactions with anyone whose background and experiences differ from my own. Recognizing and understanding cultural differences gives me an opportunity to reflect on the "why" of certain interactions and to begin understanding those interactions from the perspective of those with different cultural backgrounds than my own. This ability has the potential to help avoid miscommunications and to diffuse uncomfortable situations, which is valuable in any setting.

### International Business Exposure
<i>Winter 2021</i>
<br><br>During my International Martketing course, I explored the various dimensions of international marketing, particularly their affect on marketing strategies. In doing this, my peers and I developed a strategy to introduce a company's product line in a new country. This required understanding the products and identifying a market that would purchase them. In this process, political, economic, social, technological, environmental, and legal compatabilites between the product line and the new market were considered. Further, my team and I evaluated competition and the needed modifications, segmentation, targeting, and positioning for the product's success in the market.
<br>
<br>My key takeaways were the complexity of international business and the importance of taking time to learn about about other cultures. While our research provided valuable insight, it would be worthwhile to travel to the new market and engage in conversation.

### Connecting Across Worldviews
<i>Winter 2022</i>
<br>
<br>In my role as the TA Coordinator for the Microsoft Office Certification Program, I continuously seek opportunities to expand our team's skill set through personal and professional growth. One example of this is working with the Inclusion & Equity Education department at DU to bring our team a workshop on worldviews and connecting across them–a session valuable in learning to consider multiple perspectives. 
<br>
<br>Every day, I interact with people who have different beliefs, expectations, and values than my own, which results in different perceptions of the same experiences. This workshop helped me better understand what worldviews are, the role they play in my interactions with others, and how I can identify commonality to connect across them. One of my key takeaways was intent versus impact and how to navigate situations in which the intent of my actions does not match the impact. Further, it served as a reminder to regularly check my assumptions (and the assumptions others may have) and to ask questions with curiosity. Following this session, I was able to implement what we discussed to more productively understand and engage with others.

### Ethics Bootcamp
<i>Winter 2020</i>
<br>
<br>As part of my Ethics and Legal Studies class, I had the opportunity to partake in Ethics Bootcamp, where I attended a variety of sessions surrounding ethics and the Daniels Fund Ethics Initiative Principles (integrity, trust, accountability, transparency, fairness, respect, rule of law, and viability). Two sessions I found most impactful were Considerations of Driverless Mobility by Professor Libbi Levine Segev and Fraud, Lies, and Hermes Ties by Aaron Beam.
<br>
<br>Driverless mobility is an interesting ethical dilemma, specifically in terms of the code behind it. Developers make decisions when writing the cars' code that impact the livelihood of the driver and their surroundings, including other people. For example, if a crash is inevitable, who or what will be protected by the car–and really by the coders behind the technology. Driverless mobility is just one of many ethical delimmas in the advancing technology space, and it poses interesting questions to be considered. This session got me thinkning about those questions and the broader implications, including the potential ethical considerations behind code I develop.
<br>
<br>Aaron Beam was co-founder and CFO of HealthSouth, and in his presentation, he shared the ethical dilemma he faced when his boss, Richard Scrushy, asked him to fix the numbers to prevent a drop in share price. Although recognizing it was wrong, Mr. Beam altered the numbers "just this once." Inevitably, this led to numerous instances of "cooking the books" until it eventually caught-up to him. My key takeaways from Mr. Beam's story is the courage it takes to act on doing right, rather than just knowing right versus wrong, and how small concessions can quickly lead to loosing oneself.
<br>
<br>Ethics Bootcamp was a rewarding and inspiring experience in collaborating with my peers to consider the role of ethics in our daily lives, and the key takeaways continue to resonate with me in the work I do and decisions I make.
